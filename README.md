# filter-it---proof-of-concept
CAS Group Project - "filter it" (proof-of-concept)

A Java group project idea to help high school students build/auto-generate personalized resumes based on the responses to a survey conducted via the app. Users are meant to login, select their desired template, and then answer questions pertaining to their resume. Upon completion, the app generates their information to a resume template which could then be saved and emailed as necessary.

Completed Areas:
1. Login/sign-up
2. Generation of questions for formal resume template
3. Creation of general structure for formal resume template

Areas for Improvement:
1. Development of resume formatting based on generated answers
2. Adding filters for different stylistic changes in resume template
3. Printing/emailing of resume
4. Modifications for remaining resume templates (i.e. art/contemporary)
